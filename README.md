# Penalty
A college project made on request of the lecturer to help demonstrate how to use Java Swing and AWT.

I was asked by the lecturer for this module to make a demonstration for other students to help them come to terms with getting started with graphics in Java.
I am also very new to Java, but I thought I would give it a go! I was given a brief on what the demo should be, specifically a penalty shootout game with commands accepted by typing, and a play again button. How it looked was all up to me.

That is also the reason for the extentsive commenting in in the code, to try and track and explain why I did what I did to people who might not be too comfortable yet with some aspects of coding. I tried to keep it as simple as possible, while still looking a little interesting.

I'm sure there's obvious mistakes and other things that I can't see as a beginner myself, but I hope it helps!

It uses only Java, with no imported images, so running it is as simple as copy and paste!
